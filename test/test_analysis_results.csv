A,3,"What percentage were not German?","83.2%",Correct,Correct,Match,"","The text states that 16.8% were of German ancestry. To find the percentage that were not German, we subtract from 100%: 100% - 16.8% = 83.2%. The answer is mathematically correct."
A,4,"What percentage were not Bulgarian?","85.4%",Correct,Correct,Match,"","The answer is correct. If 14.6% of the population were of Bulgarian ancestry, then 100% - 14.6% = 85.4% were not of Bulgarian ancestry."
A,5,"What percentage were not Italian?","90.3%",Correct,Correct,Match,"","The text states that 9.7% were of Italian ancestry. To find the percentage that were not Italian, we subtract from 100%: 100% - 9.7% = 90.3%. The answer is mathematically correct."
A,6,"What percentage were neither Russian nor Ukrainian?","55.7%",Correct,Correct,Match,"","The answer is correct. By subtracting the Russian percentage (24.9%) and Ukrainian percentage (19.4%) from 100%, we get 100% - 24.9% - 19.4% = 55.7% for those who were neither Russian nor Ukrainian."
A,7,"What percentage were neither Russian nor German?","58.3%",Correct,Correct,Match,"","The calculation is correct. Adding the Russian percentage (24.9%) and German percentage (16.8%) gives 41.7%, so subtracting from 100% leaves 58.3% who were neither Russian nor German ancestry."
A,8,"What percentage were neither Russian nor Bulgarian?","60.5%",Correct,Correct,Match,"","The calculation is correct. If 24.9% were Russian and 14.6% were Bulgarian, then 100% - 24.9% - 14.6% = 60.5% were neither Russian nor Bulgarian."
A,9,"What percentage were neither Russian nor Italian?","65.4%",Correct,Correct,Match,"","The calculation is correct. If 24.9% were Russian and 9.7% were Italian, then 34.6% were either Russian or Italian, leaving 65.4% who were neither Russian nor Italian."
A,10,"What percentage were neither Ukrainian nor German?","63.8%",Correct,Correct,Match,"","The calculation is correct. If 19.4% were Ukrainian and 16.8% were German, then 100% - 19.4% - 16.8% = 63.8% were neither Ukrainian nor German ancestry."
A,11,"What percentage were neither Ukrainian nor Bulgarian?","66.0%",Correct,Correct,Match,"","The calculation is correct. If 19.4% were Ukrainian and 14.6% were Bulgarian, then 100% - 19.4% - 14.6% = 66.0% were neither Ukrainian nor Bulgarian, assuming these are mutually exclusive ancestry categories."
A,12,"What percentage were neither Ukrainian nor Italian?","70.9%",Correct,Correct,Match,"","The calculation is correct. If 19.4% were Ukrainian and 9.7% were Italian, then 100% - 19.4% - 9.7% = 70.9% were neither Ukrainian nor Italian."
A,13,"What percentage were neither German nor Bulgarian?","68.6%",Correct,Correct,Match,"","The calculation is correct. If 16.8% were German and 14.6% were Bulgarian, then 100% - 16.8% - 14.6% = 68.6% were neither German nor Bulgarian ancestry."
A,14,"What percentage were neither German nor Italian?","73.5%",Correct,Correct,Match,"","The calculation is correct. 16.8% were German and 9.7% were Italian, so 26.5% were either German or Italian. Therefore, 100% - 26.5% = 73.5% were neither German nor Italian."

A,16,"What percentage were neither Russian, Ukrainian nor German?","72.5%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The calculation is incorrect. Russian (24.9%) + Ukrainian (19.4%) + German (16.8%) = 61.1%. Therefore, 100% - 61.1% = 38.9% were neither Russian, Ukrainian, nor German, not 72.5%."
A,17,"What percentage were neither Russian, Ukrainian nor Bulgarian?","74.8%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The calculation is wrong. Russian (24.9%) + Ukrainian (19.4%) + Bulgarian (14.6%) = 58.9%. Therefore, 100% - 58.9% = 41.1% were neither Russian, Ukrainian, nor Bulgarian, not 74.8%."
A,18,"What percentage were neither Russian, Ukrainian nor Italian?","79.2%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The answer should be 46.0%, not 79.2%. The calculation is: 100% - (24.9% + 19.4% + 9.7%) = 100% - 54.0% = 46.0%"
A,19,"What percentage were neither Russian, German nor Bulgarian?","77.1%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The answer should be 43.7%, not 77.1%. The calculation is: 100% - (24.9% + 16.8% + 14.6%) = 100% - 56.3% = 43.7%"
A,20,"What percentage were neither Russian, German nor Italian?","82.4%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The answer should be 48.6%. The calculation requires subtracting Russian (24.9%) + German (16.8%) + Italian (9.7%) = 51.4% from 100%, which equals 48.6%. The given answer of 82.4% appears to be based on an incorrect calculation."
A,21,"What percentage were neither Russian, Bulgarian nor Italian?","84.6%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The answer is incorrect. Russian (24.9%) + Bulgarian (14.6%) + Italian (9.7%) = 49.2%. Therefore, 100% - 49.2% = 50.8% were neither Russian, Bulgarian, nor Italian, not 84.6%."
A,22,"What percentage were neither Ukrainian, German nor Bulgarian?","81.7%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The answer of 81.7% is incorrect. The percentage of people who were neither Ukrainian, German, nor Bulgarian should be 100% - (19.4% + 16.8% + 14.6%) = 100% - 50.8% = 49.2%."
A,23,"What percentage were neither Ukrainian, German nor Italian?","86.9%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The answer should be 54.1%. To find those who were neither Ukrainian, German, nor Italian, we add the three percentages (19.4% + 16.8% + 9.7% = 45.9%) and subtract from 100%, giving us 54.1%, not 86.9%."
A,24,"What percentage were neither Ukrainian, Bulgarian nor Italian?","89.1%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The answer of 89.1% is incorrect. The combined percentage of Ukrainian (19.4%), Bulgarian (14.6%), and Italian (9.7%) ancestry is 43.7%. Therefore, 100% - 43.7% = 56.3% were neither Ukrainian, Bulgarian, nor Italian."
A,25,"What percentage were neither German, Bulgarian nor Italian?","91.5%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The answer of 91.5% is incorrect. The combined percentage of German, Bulgarian, and Italian ancestry is 41.1% (16.8% + 14.6% + 9.7%). Therefore, the percentage that were neither German, Bulgarian, nor Italian is 100% - 41.1% = 58.9%."
A,26,"What percentage were neither Russian, Ukrainian, German nor Bulgarian?","87.9%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The calculation is wrong. Adding the four ancestries (Russian 24.9% + Ukrainian 19.4% + German 16.8% + Bulgarian 14.6%) equals 75.7%. Therefore, those who were neither of these four ancestries would be 100% - 75.7% = 24.3%, not 87.9%."
A,27,"What percentage were neither Russian, Ukrainian, German nor Italian?","92.8%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The answer of 92.8% is incorrect. The four listed ethnicities (Russian 24.9%, Ukrainian 19.4%, German 16.8%, Italian 9.7%) total 70.8%, so those who were neither of these four ethnicities would be 100% - 70.8% = 29.2%."
A,28,"What percentage were neither Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian nor Italian?","95.0%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The answer should be 31.4%. The percentage of people who were Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, or Italian totals 68.6% (24.9% + 19.4% + 14.6% + 9.7%), so those who were neither of these four groups would be 100% - 68.6% = 31.4%, not 95.0%."
A,29,"What percentage were neither Russian, German, Bulgarian nor Italian?","97.4%",Incorrect,Incorrect,Match,"","The answer is incorrect. To find the percentage that were neither Russian, German, Bulgarian nor Italian, we need to add up those four percentages and subtract from 100%. Russian (24.9%) + German (16.8%) + Bulgarian (14.6%) + Italian (9.7%) = 66.0%. Therefore, 100% - 66.0% = 34.0% were neither Russian, German, Bulgarian nor Italian. The given answer of 97.4% is far too high."
A,30,"What percentage were neither Ukrainian, German, Bulgarian nor Italian?","39.5%",Correct,Correct,Match,"","The answer is correct.
