## Project Overview

The **Claude 4 Sonnet Math Evaluation** project dives into the performance of Claude 4 Sonnet in solving mathematical problems. The research highlights how the model achieves 100% accuracy on incorrect answers but only 84.3% on correct ones. This discrepancy arises from premature decision-making in the JSON structure, affecting the overall evaluation process.

### Objectives

- Assess the accuracy of Claude 4 Sonnet in mathematical reasoning.
- Identify systematic errors in LLM evaluation tasks.
- Analyze JSON-induced errors and their impact on performance.

## Key Findings

The analysis of Claude 4 Sonnet yielded several key insights:

1. **Accuracy Discrepancies**: The model demonstrates a 100% accuracy rate on incorrect answers, indicating a possible overfitting issue or misinterpretation of problem statements.

2. **Correct Answer Challenges**: The 84.3% accuracy on correct answers suggests that the model struggles with maintaining focus on the correct logical flow, leading to premature conclusions.

3. **JSON Structure Issues**: The evaluation revealed that the JSON structure used in the assessment process may contribute to these inaccuracies. Proper structuring and validation are essential for improving performance.

4. **Systematic Patterns**: The evaluation identified patterns in errors, which can be useful for refining the model and enhancing its mathematical reasoning capabilities.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 500 original mathematical problems, carefully curated to challenge the model's reasoning abilities. Each problem is designed to test different aspects of mathematical understanding, from basic arithmetic to complex problem-solving.

### Dataset Structure

- **Problem ID**: Unique identifier for each problem.
- **Problem Statement**: The mathematical problem presented to the model.
- **Expected Answer**: The correct answer for validation.
- **Model Response**: The answer generated by Claude 4 Sonnet.
- **Evaluation Result**: Indicates whether the model's response was correct or incorrect.

### Download the Dataset

You can download the dataset from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Simon20393/claude_4_sonnet_math_evaluation/releases). Make sure to follow the instructions to execute the dataset correctly.

## Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation of Claude 4 Sonnet employs various metrics to assess its performance:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct answers out of the total problems.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive results to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive results to the total actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

These metrics help in understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses, guiding future improvements.
